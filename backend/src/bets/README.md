# Bets Module (`backend/src/bets`)

## What it does

Server-side betting engine. The balance (T$) and the bets are stored in the
database, so they survive a page refresh, cannot be changed from the browser
and stay consistent when many users bet at the same time.

A user bets that a coin's price will go **up** or **down** in the next 60
seconds. The server records the live Kraken price when the bet is placed and
compares it with the live price when the 60 seconds are over.

## Rules

| Rule | Value | Defined in |
|------|-------|------------|
| Starting balance of a new account | 1000 T$, set by the server | `STARTING_BALANCE`, used in `users.service.ts` |
| Bet duration | 60 s from the moment the bet is placed | `BET_DURATION_SECONDS` |
| Win (price moved in the chosen direction) | stake × 1.85 credited (stake back + 85%) | `PAYOUT_MULTIPLIER` |
| Loss | the stake is lost | |
| Same price at the end | stake refunded | |
| Bet settled more than 10 s late (backend down) | stake refunded | `LATE_SETTLEMENT_MS` |
| Coins | those with a live Kraken price: BTC, ETH | `KrakenService` |

All values are in `bets.constants.ts`.

## How a bet works

1. `POST /users/me/bets` reads the live price from `KrakenService`, debits the
   stake and creates the bet (`status: "active"`, `expiresAt` = now + 60 s),
   all in one database transaction.
2. Every second, `BetsService` looks for active bets whose `expiresAt` has
   passed and settles them with the live price: it sets `status`, `exitPrice`,
   `payout` and `settledAt`, credits the payout and updates `wins`/`losses`
   on the user, again in one transaction.

### Why it is safe with many users at the same time

- **No overdraft**: the stake is debited with a single conditional update,
  `UPDATE "User" SET wallet = wallet - amount WHERE id = ? AND wallet >= amount`.
  PostgreSQL runs it atomically, so simultaneous bets can never take the
  balance below zero. Tested: 8 simultaneous bets of 300 T$ with 1000 T$ →
  exactly 3 accepted.
- **Never paid twice**: settlement only pays if it is the one that moves the
  bet out of `"active"` (`UPDATE ... WHERE id = ? AND status = 'active'`).
- **Prices come from the server**: the client only sends coin, direction and
  amount; it can never choose the entry or exit price, or its balance.

## Endpoints

All endpoints require a logged-in user: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
(`JwtAuthGuard`), otherwise `401 Unauthorized`.

They live under `/users/me` because nginx already forwards `/users` to the
backend, so no nginx change was needed.

### `GET /users/me/balance` — Balance of the logged-in user

#### Response `200`

```json
{ "balance": 900 }
```

---

### `POST /users/me/bets` — Place a bet

#### Request body

```json
{ "coin": "BTC", "direction": "up", "amount": 100 }
```

`CreateBetDto` validation:

| Field       | Type    | Constraints                                   |
|-------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `coin`      | string  | required, 2–10 letters; must have a live price (BTC, ETH) |
| `direction` | string  | required, `up` or `down`                      |
| `amount`    | integer | required, 1 to 1,000,000, and ≤ the balance   |

Any other field is rejected (global `ValidationPipe` with `forbidNonWhitelisted`).

#### Response `201`

```json
{
  "bet": {
    "id": 12,
    "coin": "BTC",
    "direction": "up",
    "amount": 100,
    "entryPrice": 71956.6,
    "exitPrice": null,
    "status": "active",
    "payout": 0,
    "expiresAt": "2026-10-29T13:06:01.531Z",
    "settledAt": null,
    "createdAt": "2026-10-29T13:05:01.534Z",
    "userId": 3
  },
  "balance": 900
}
```

#### Errors `400 Bad Request`

```json
{ "message": "Insufficient balance", "error": "Bad Request", "statusCode": 400 }
{ "message": "No live price for DOGE", "error": "Bad Request", "statusCode": 400 }
```

Invalid fields return the usual validation messages.

### `GET /users/me/bets` — Bets of the logged-in user

Newest first. Query parameters (optional):

| Param    | Values                | Default |
|----------|-----------------------|---------|
| `status` | `active` or `settled` | all     |
| `limit`  | 1–100                 | 20      |

#### Response `200`

An array of bet objects (same shape as above). A settled bet has `status`
`won`, `lost` or `refunded`, plus `exitPrice`, `payout` and `settledAt`
(`exitPrice` is `null` for a bet refunded because it was settled too late).

## Bet fields

| Field        | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `coin`       | `BTC` or `ETH` |
| `direction`  | `up` or `down` |
| `amount`     | stake in T$, debited when the bet is placed |
| `entryPrice` | live price (EUR) when the bet was placed |
| `exitPrice`  | live price (EUR) when the bet was settled |
| `status`     | `active`, `won`, `lost` or `refunded` |
| `payout`     | T$ credited at settlement: `floor(amount × 1.85)` if won, `amount` if refunded, `0` if lost |
| `expiresAt`  | when the bet ends (placement + 60 s) |
| `settledAt`  | when the server settled it (at most about 1 s after `expiresAt`) |

## Frontend integration notes

- Show the balance from `GET /users/me/balance`, or from the `balance`
  returned by `POST /users/me/bets`, instead of the local value of 1000.
- Each bet lasts 60 s from the moment it is placed: there are no rounds and
  no queued bets on the server. A countdown can use `expiresAt`.
- About 1–2 s after `expiresAt`, read `GET /users/me/bets?status=settled` and
  the balance to show the result.
- Only `BTC` and `ETH` have live prices.
- The registration form can keep sending `wallet`: it is ignored.
- For errors, show the `message` of the `400` response.

## Testing

`scripts/test-bets.sh` creates two users and checks every rule above through
nginx (about 75 seconds, because it waits for the bets to be settled).
